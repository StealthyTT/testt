blueprint:
  name: Binary Sensor with Multiple Lights Control and Toggle Logic (No Helpers with Custom Times)
  description: |
    Turns on multiple lights when the binary sensor detects motion, disables the automation if any of the lights is toggled off and on twice within a short time,
    and re-enables it if any of the lights has been off for a configurable amount of time. This version allows you to set the reset time and the light-off duration without helpers, and does not use a timer.
