  name: Binary Sensor with Light Control and Toggle Logic (No Helpers with Custom Times)
  description: |
    Turns on the light when the binary sensor detects motion, disables the automation if the light is toggled off and on twice within a short time,
    and re-enables it if the light has been off for a configurable amount of time. This version allows you to set the reset time and the light-off duration without helpers.
